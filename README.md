# 🏀 Basketball Scoreboard 🏀 

This is my first work with NodeJS, where information about matches from the Backend is taken and displayed on the page.
An analog web design has been created and depicts the points earned by the team, raised round, date and time.

## ✔️ Install

### 🔴 _BackEnd_

Run this code in Back directory after downloading source code:

  - npm install

After dependencies installation run a command:

  - npm run dev - `Server should be succesfully running.`

> Server start with :3001 port -> [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001)

#### _More info_

I used:
- `nodemon`
- `express`      
- `core` for join two servers.


### 🟡 _FrontEnd_ 

Do same in Front directory:

  - npm install
  - npm run dev

> Frontend server start with :5000 port -> [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

#### _More info_

Using `dead-server` for live page prewiev.
